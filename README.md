# Live2dOnWebLite
A Cubism SDK 4 for web lite version modified from Live2dOnWeb

This is a lite version of [Live2dOnWeb](https://github.com/Konata09/Live2dOnWeb).
I removed many additional functions and remain only a character model to show on your web page.

I use it for [my blog](https://ashenone66.cn)

### 2021/08/23 update

add several models from sdvx

modify the value of live2d_bundle.js `setHeight` function to fix the issue that some model is too small
